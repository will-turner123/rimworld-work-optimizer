# Rimworld Work Priority Optimizer
(Work in progress, likely to be abandoned)
This script aims to make playing one of my favorite games, Rimworld, a little easier :)

Screenshot of example save found in /saves. Modlist included in the save meta if you're interested.

Each colonist, called a pawn, has a set of skills. There are various work benches which some pawns can use to produce items for the colony. Colonists with certain skills perform tasks at workbenches better and some workbenches are skill locked. You wouldn't want a pawn with no idea how to cook assigned to cooking, otherwise everybody will get food poisoning!

Pawns have a priority list which can get pretty hard to manage, especially in the later game. 

This script aims to read the game's save file to get all the colonists different skills, get all the bills on workbenches and auto-optimize work priorities for maximum efficiency, based off all of the existing bills
